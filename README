NOTES

This new js.io branch is an attempt to implement various twisted 
constructs/apis for javascript. Most notably missing is a Deferred... but
expect to see some kind of reasonable concurrency construct soon.

DEPLOYMENt
You can run your js.io servers on node, and js.io clients in the browser using
Orbited (or jacob's node port of orbited, or desmaj's erlang port of Orbited,
or the ape project.)

STEP-BY-STEP

install node
run: node echoserver.js

install orbited
run: orbited
(it will automatically find orbited.cfg)
Visit in firefox: http://localhost:8000/test
firebug's console: connect();
firebug console: c.write('hello world');
